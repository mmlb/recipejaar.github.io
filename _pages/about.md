<p>Thanks a ton for visiting! Welcome to the world of flavors and aroma and I strongly believe that you will enjoy your time here! Here you will get all possible food-related stuff – recipes, videos, ideas, tips & tricks.</p>

<p>Let me introduce myself, I'm Shweta Rajput and Recipe Jaar is a space where I put up my food ideas. Cooking is challenging, inspirational, creative and therapeutic for me. My passion is making as well as developing recipes and bring a twist in regular dishes. I also like to experiment and develop new dishes with different spices. Food styling, gardening and collecting props is my other obsession! </p>


<p>As a full time, Marketing Manager, enthusiastic traveler and a part-time food blogger. Basically, from Varanasi, I’m currently working at Bangalore. My Favourite things include my camera, Weekends, Binge Watching Series and mostly food.</p>

<p>I’m the voice, author, and creator behind Recipe Jaar. It started as a casual hobby for late nights and weekends while I was working away from my home and family. I want to create fun recipes that will reach millions of people. </p>


<p>In this space, I will be sharing fresh, flavourful, (mostly) healthy recipes that I love to make and eat in my real, actual, everyday life. If I wouldn’t eat it in real life, I won’t put it in on the blog. My goal is to inspire you with food that is both approachable and exciting, whether you’re cooking for yourself, your family, your roommates, or your friends. I want you to be so excited about these recipes that you eagerly await when you can go home from work and start cooking.</p>

<p>On a related note, I LOVE seeing the food that you’re making. It will make my day if you tag <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/recipejaar/">@recipejaar</a> in your Instagram photos and stories!</p>
